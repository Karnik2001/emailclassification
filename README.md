# Email Classification

Emails are a daily task in everybody lives, however, spam emails have become an increasing potential threat to security mainly on a financial level. With the power of data analytics using machine learning techniques, spam emails can be detected and be prevented. In this simple project, I have a implemented the classification method to classify whether an email is a spam or ham (real). 

Steps 

1. Import all of the necessary python libraries and load the dataset.
2. Check the data type which were objects.
3. Rename columns and encode numerical labels.
4. Check for missing values.
5. Download the appriopriate the NLTK resources.
6. Remove a set of words to reduce the noise as the model is being executed.
7. Create a text preprocessing function.
8. Preprocess the data.
9. Transform the text data and remove any rows with NaN.
10. Split the data.
11. Initalize and train the model.
12. Make predictions and evaluate the performance of the model.
13. Save the model.

Conclusion :
The accuracy score is 97.2% indictating the model does an excellent job of classifying the emails to protect financial information from potential threats. With this simple model, it can be utilized in several industries to increase financial security involving financial data.
